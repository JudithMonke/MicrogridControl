# MicrogridControl
Control on Microgrid (IEEE 123)
A supervisory controller manages the dispatching of resources and maintains the frequency stability of the grid during outages or islanding conditions by adjusting BESS power command. 
Communication errors between the controller and the devices, due to external attacks or delays, could lead to malfunctioning of the controls and disconnection of the devices (IEEE 1547-2003 standard)  resulting in a frequency drop. In this context, 
the DMD plays a crucial role in monitoring frequency control to prevent such situations and promptly restore the frequency to a safe and appropriate condition.
The IEEE 123 Test Feeder is considered and modelled in ePHASORsim to represent mediium-complex 3-phase unbalanced netwok configurable in microgrids with the addition of  photovoltaic (PV) systems PSS/E model.
